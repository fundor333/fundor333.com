# The story

I had different work espiriences with big data and data analysis and so I describe it with tea. This is a personal rant and I will use some personal experience with tea for describe some experiences about data management.

## Industrial Unamed Tea - Excel file

> We don't need to make analisys

THE big data for the NEWEST company. You can only use _.xls_, _.xlsx_ e _.csv_ file for it. Sometime you can use some _advance_ system as _Google Sheet_ or _Excel 360_. For make an analisys you need one-two month for one result. Any time you make an analisys you need to redo all the things. This is the oldest thing to do for make an analisys.

This is a industrial tea, the one you can find in all the pubs.
Many time is a _ultra low cost_ leamon tea and you only drink it because you are so sick that you only can drink this or water.
If you are not sick you will not drink it because it taste only like leamon not tea.

## Named Tea - Axcess db

> You know what you want but you don't know how to get it

You have an idea of what you want, you have a tool look like the right one but is too '80 maybe '90.
Sometime this is the good tool but many, many time this is the obsolete one.

As a named tea. You are using because you allways used it or because your family/company allways used it and you never search for an alternative.

This one is where you have some space for progress for the big data


## Assam Black Tea - Generic DB with Web app

> We start in a good way
